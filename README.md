# Visitor_Analysis_IceAgeTrail
Project for the Ice Age Trail Alliance (WI) analyze customer segmentation through data analysis techniques such as regression and data visualization. I was particularly responsible for the data analysis portion of this project. The data used was aggregated through approximately 4,000 survey responses from the users of the trail.

Analyzing the data from two quantitative surveys reveals visitors’ sentiments about the Ice Age Trail along with their spending preferences as it relates to their interaction with local trail communities and their expenditures on travel, shopping, and dining.

Logistic Regression and Classification and Regression Tree algorithms were implemented using the statistical software R to anlyze the behaviors of the Ice Age Trail useres. In summary, these models explain certain activities for which the Ice Age Trail is being utilized, which helps us understand who and how to attract more visitors or have the current visitors spend more time on the Ice Age Trail. We find that the number of visits increase (holding all else constant) for the visitors who:
•	Typically, do not stay overnight for trips to the Ice Age Trail
•	Listed “live in the area” as their main purpose for visiting the Ice Age Trail
•	Are familiar with the term “IAT” and or an active volunteer for the IATA (Ice Age Trail Alliance)
•	Utilize the Ice Age Trail for activities such as trail running/jogging, snowshoeing and wellness/fitness
•	State “engaging terrain” as the most appealing characteristic of the Ice Age Trail
•	Utilize the Ice Age Trail more often during fall, summer and spring seasons in comparison to the winter season
•	Become aware of the Ice Age Trail using the radio and not using social media platforms or state tourism publications
•	Spend a higher amount on overnight accommodations and restaurants/bars in comparison to other items
We now further analyze the data and examine our findings using Classification and Regression Trees (CART), which identify distinct subgroups of respondents who would spend more time at their lake property if the water quality improved, based on subsets with different responses to certain questions held constant. Using the same sets of questions for independent variables as the regression models, we can visualize which questions are most predictive of the respondent’s interest in spending more time at the lake.
